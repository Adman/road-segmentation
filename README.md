# road-segmentation

This repository aims to provide a simple environment to easily train and test convolutional
neural network models for semantic segmentation task.

## Dependencies

The best way to set the environment up is to install Anaconda or Miniconda which
should manage the installation of CUDA for you.
After creating and activating conda virtual environment, install dependencies by running

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
